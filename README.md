Team (oop-team2)
-----------------

We were working on this project in groups of three students. Our group
"oop-team2" consisted of Eric Hebing, Joachim Streit and me, Marvin Klimke.

My primary task was to prepare the inter-process communication in the projects
`ipc-backend` and `ipc-frontend` as well as the integration into the the main
projects `backend` and `frontend`. Joachim was mainly working on the `backend`
while Eric was making the `frontend`.
